## API Integration

The extension supports multiple LLM providers:

### OpenAI

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "model": "gpt-4"
}
```

### Anthropic

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "model": "claude-3-sonnet"
}
```

### Custom API

```json
{
  "provider": "custom",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "model": "your-model",
  "baseUrl": "https://your-api.com/v1"
}
```

## Security

- API keys are stored securely in Chrome's sync storage
- All API calls are made from the background script
- Content scripts only handle DOM manipulation
- No data is sent to third parties except your configured LLM provider

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Extension not working**: Make sure you've configured your API key in settings
2. **Changes not applying**: Check that the content script is loaded (look for the ðŸ¤– button)
3. **API errors**: Verify your API key and model name are correct

### Debug Mode

Enable Chrome's developer tools to see console logs from the extension.
